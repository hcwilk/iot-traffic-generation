## IoT Traffic Generation Tool

**⚠️ This file is deprecated. Please see README.md for current documentation.**

This tool was designed so that anyone can generate traffic they want from a bunch of separate IP addresses within their network.

I specifically designed it so that I was able to spoof a bunch of random IoT appliances to show that our IoT Security Subscription worked.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup (run once)
sudo ./setup.sh

# Start all IoT devices  
./manage.sh start

# Monitor device activity
./manage.sh logs
```

For complete documentation, see README.md

## Docker Commands

Remove all running containers
```bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -q)
```
